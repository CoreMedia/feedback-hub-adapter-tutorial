# Displaying Feedback with the CoreMedia Feedback Hub 

## Overview 

In this tutorial we are going to learn about how to use the CoreMedia Feedback Hub API.
It explains step-by-step how to set up a new CoreMedia Extension for the Feedback Hub
and how to build a new Feedback Hub adapter or provider with the
corresponding classes, localization, error handling, etc..

## Versioning

To find out which CoreMedia versions are supported by this project, 
please take look at the releases section or on the existing branches. 
To find the matching version of your CoreMedia system, please checkout the branch 
with the corresponding name. For example, 
if your CoreMedia version is 2104.1, checkout the branch 2104.1.


## Getting Started

The project is a plugin for the CoreMedia Blueprint workspace.
To include it, perform the following steps:

- clone this project
- build it via `mvn clean install`

__Java Plugin Modules__
- Ensure that the Spring application property `plugins.directory`
 of the webapp points to 
the generated zip archive generated by the build process, or copy the generated zip
file to the `plugins.directory` folder of the server.
- (Re-)start the server so that the zip file is extracted and loaded.

__Studio Plugin Modules__

- When you have a CoreMedia environment where the Java modules of this plugin are already deployed
or this plugin does not have any Java plugin modules, just invoke the following command
from the root directory of your _Blueprint_ workspace: `mvn jangaroo:run -pl :studio-app -Dinstallation.host=<YOUR_TEST_SYSTEM_HOST>`

- If you want to use your local Studio, execute the following steps, start the Studio server
and invoke the following command from the root directory of the _Blueprint_ workspace:
`mvn jangaroo:run -pl :studio-app -DadditionalPackagesDir=C:/feedback-hub-adapter-tutorial/studio-client/target/app`
The parameter `installation.host` is not required here, since we are working 
with a local Studio server.

Finally, login to the Studio at URL http://localhost:8080.
    
__Plugin Deployment__    

For details how to deploy plugins to a CoreMedia environment, please 
check section *Developing with Plugins* of the Blueprint Development 
manual (https://www.coremedia.com/en/services/downloads).

## How To Read This Tutorial

There are two possibilities to implement your Feedback Hub adapter, depending
on your use case. This tutorial covers both cases in separate sections: 

**FeedbackHubAdapter**
 
The Feedback Hub has predefined `FeedbackHubAdapters`. They offer some prefabrication
to make the integration of similar services easier. One example for this
is the `BlobKeywordsFeedbackHubAdapter` which already gives us the blob the keywords 
should be extracted from. Please check the documentation for the list of existing
`FeedbackHubAdapters`. 

Tutorial Link: **[Implementing a FeedbackAdapter](example_adapter.md)**

**FeedbackProvider**

The `FeedbackProvider` interface is the general interface to implement for any
kind of feedback. It does not offer any kind of prefabrication and can be used
if none of the existing `FeedbackHubAdapters` are applicable for your usecase.

## CoreMedia Labs

Welcome to [CoreMedia Labs](https://blog.coremedia.com/labs/)! This repository
is part of a platform for developers who want to have a look under the hood or
get some hands-on understanding of the vast and compelling capabilities of
CoreMedia. Whatever your experience level with CoreMedia is, we've got something
for you.

Each project in our Labs platform is an extra feature to be used with CoreMedia,
including extensions, tools and 3rd party integrations. We provide some test
data and explanatory videos for non-customers and for insiders there is
open-source code and instructions on integrating the feature into your
CoreMedia workspace. 

The code we provide is meant to be example code, illustrating a set of features
that could be used to enhance your CoreMedia experience. We'd love to hear your
feedback on use-cases and further developments! If you're having problems with
our code, please refer to our issues section. If you already have a solution to 
an issue, we love to review and integrate your pull requests.
